# HuaWeiProject
For my HuaWei-products-repository project.

This term I have learnt Java,this is my term-work.I finished it by myself.
But there are not so many functions,just for a fresh man to learn about Java and HTML.

If you want to create a web HTML,you could reference this one,though it doesn't perfect.
I advice that open this project by VSCode.

# How to use it
Download and open it by VSCode.

Find the .vscode folder and change the "file" key's value in launch.json.
For example,if you download it in "D:\",you should change like this:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Open regist.html",
            "file": "D:\\HuaWeiProject-main\\regist.html"
        }
    ]
}
```
Then you can run this project without problem.
